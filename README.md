Pomodoro Timer
====================
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer for Mac OS X. A Pomodoro Timer lets you start a
timer for some task you want to do, default is 25 minutes, and then the next
timer is ready to go, this time for a short rest period, default 5 minutes.  The
fourth rest period is longer, default 15 minutes.




To run requires pyqt4, soundfile and sounddevice. Once you have all of those
just run 
```python pomodoroTimer.py```

Changing the preset lengths in that file lets you change the lengths of the
Pomodoros (in minutes).
